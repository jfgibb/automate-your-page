        What is Computer Science
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
           <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a> is about how to solve problems by breaking the down into smaller pieces</li>
           <li>Then define a sequence of steps that you can precisely solve each smaller problem</li>
           <li>The steps must be able to be executed by a computer</li>
           <li>Programing is the core of Computer Science</li>
           <li>Focus on how to break down problems and not solving them in one big sweep</li>
           <li>A computer is a multi-purpose device (it can do many things), not like a toaster that has a very focused purpose</li>
           <li>But a computer canâ€™t do anything without a program</li>
           <li>A program tells the computer what to do</li>
           <li>A program must be very systematic and precise because a computer at its heart is "dumb" and only does what its told to by the program</li>
           <li>Computers can execute programs very very fast</li>

        The Python Programming Language
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <ul>
          <li>Python is one of many programming languages availalbe</li>
          <li>It is a high level language and relatively easy to use compared to lover level languages</li>
          <li>This stage will use Python to introduce programing and the many concepts common to programing</li>
          <li>The programs we will create will run on the Python program</li>
          <li>Python defines a set of syntax and rules that must be followed by the programer for the computer to run the program</li>
          <li>The Python program will take the high level statements in the program and convert them to the low level language the computer understands</li>
          <li>This function is called an interperter</li>
          <li>The following quote from Dave contains 3 of the 5 ways we can think like a programmer "The programs you'll write in this class will be Python code. Those will be input to another program which is a Python interpreter that follows the instructions in your code and it does that by following the instruction in its code... and you'll be able to run all that using your web browser."</li>
        </ul>
          <div class="indent">
            <ul>
              <li>The line "...follows the instructions in your code..." references the procedural thinking required of programmers</li>
              <li>The entire quote demonstrates a deep technological empathy (which you don't need to have at this point) for how computers and programs work</li>
              <li>When Dave thinks of a Python program, a Python interpreter, and a web browser as different versions of the same thing (a computer program) he's showing abstract thinking</li>
            </ul>

        Starting Python
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <ul>
          <li>Python code is entered into an editor or a command line</li>
          <li>The "Print" command will print something to the screen</li>
          <li>The format of <em>Print</em> is Print &lt;expresion&gt;</li>
          <li>The expression will be printed to the screen</li> 
          <li>Expresions can be simple (a word) or complex (results of a math equestion)</li>

        Why Not Just use Normal Language to Program
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <ul>
          <li>It would seem simpler to program a computer using natual language like Mr. Scott tries to in <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE">Star Trek IV</a></li>
          <li>But natural languages are ambiguous and a computer needs precise instructions</li>
          <li>Natural languages are very verbose; in a programming language a complex item can be defined in a few lines</li>
          <li>A programing language will allow us to tell a computer what to do in a very precise way</li>

        Python Rules and Grammer
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <ul>
          <li>The Python interpreter only understands the rules of the python language, if you do something not supported it will create an error when you run the program</li>
          <li>Python has a grammar like a natural language does</li>  
          <li>The difference in Python is you have to follow the grammar where in natural language you can not follow the grammar and someone may still be able to understand</li>
          <li>Grammar based on Backus-Naur form:</li>
        </ul>
          <div class="indent">
            <ul>
              <li>Created by John Backus - leading developer of Fortran in the 1950s</li>
              <li>Form included a statement of code with a comment on what that line did</li>
              <li>First ways to program were not precise enough and this form helped programs be more precise</li>
              <li>Backus-Naur was invented to precisely describe exactly the language in an easy to understand and also be very concise</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <ul>
        <li>Due to this Python grammar is much more precise than english grammar</li>

          Basic Operators and Expessions
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>An <em>Expression</em> is something that has a value</li>
            <li>Two expressions can be combined with an <em>operator</em> to create a new expression</li>
            <li>Some examples of python operators are +, -, *, and /</li>
            <li>Example, Print 5 + 5 will result in 10 being printed</li>
            <li>Numbers in python can be differnt types, integers and floats are two examples</li>
            <li>An integer will not have  decimal point while a float will</li>
            <li>Its important to understand what type you are working with or the result may not be what you expect</li>
            <li>For example, multipling two integers will result in an integar but multipling an integar and float will result in a float</li>

          Varriables
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>The varriable is one of the most important concepts in computer programming</li>
            <li>A varriable is a place to store different data types (numbers, strings) within the program and to change them (hence the name varriable) as needed</li>
            <li>Varriables are created using a varriable name, the assigment operator (assigment uses the = sign), and then an expression</li>
            <li>The varriable name refers to the value of the expression that was assigned</li>   
            <li>An example:  My_Name = 'John'</li>
            <li>My_Name if the varriable name and John if the value it holds</li>
            <li>Varriable Names should be descriptive of what they hold</li>
            <li>Its important to note the = sign in Python does not mean equal like it does in math, it means assignement.  The == means equal in Python</li>
            <li>Varriables must be initiallized before they are used in a program.  This means they have to have something assigned to it even if that value is nothing (empty string)</li>

          Strings and String Indexing
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>A <em>String</em> is a sequence of characters surrounded by single quotes </li>
            <li>Example:  'John'</li>
            <li>The + operator can be used to concatinate two strings</li> 
            <li>Example:  'Jo' + 'hn' becomes 'John'</li>
            <li>A number can be a string if it has quotes around it '22' but you cannot add it to an integer if it is</li>
            <li>Indexing allows us to pull out parts of a string based on the position of that part within the string</li>
            <li>Each character within a string has a position number or index</li>
            <li>The first character is a position 0, the second at position 1 and so on</li>
            <li>'John' - J is at position 0</li>
            <li>Use the [ ] to pull out the character at the position</li>
            <li>'John[2] will output 'h'</li>
            <li>If the string is assigned to avarriable the varriable name can be used</li>
            <li>My_Name = 'John' My_Name[3] would output 'n'</li>
            <li>A negitive index will search from the end of the string.  My_Name[-1] will give 'n'</li>   
            <li>An index range can be give to get more than one character. My_Name[1:2] would give 'on'</li> 
            <li>The <em>.find</em> method is a built in program in python to ind a sub-string within a larger string</li>  
            <li>Format:  &lt;sting&gt;.find(search term)</li>   
            <li>The output is the starting location (index) of the search term, if the search term is not found the output is -1</li>
            <li>The # symple is to create a comment in a python program (the interperter will ignore the line</li>
            <li>The triple quotes """ is used to create multi-line comments</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Functions are smaller sub-sections of a program that take input from another part of the program, run some code, and send output back to the part of the program that made the call of the function</li>
            <li>They allow the program to be broken down into small sub-programs and also allow a certain thing to be coded once and accessed each time its needed from the larger program</li>
            <li>Functions are the key thing that allows for complex programs to be created</li>
            <li>Functions are all about taking things as input and producing some output</li>
            <li>Function syntax:  &lt;function name&gt; (input, input, ...)</li>
            <li>The inputs are the varriables passed into it and there can be any number of them but the call must pass in that many inputs</li>
            <li>Names of the inputs do not have to be the same as the names used in the calling section of the program</li>
            <li>To pass the result back to the calling section of code the <em>return</em> word is used:  &lt;return&gt;</li>
            <li>The code that executes and the varriables used inside a function are not visable outside the function</li>

        <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>Conditional statemens (if/then) are used in programs to evaluate an expression (test expression) and depending on the result take one action or another</li>
            <li>A number of operators are available for the test expression including equal to (==), not equal to (!=), less than (&lt;), and greater than (&gt;)</li>
            <li>If the restult of the test expression is True then the code that follows gets executed</li>
            <li>If the test expression is False then there are a couple of options, one is to do nothing and just continue with the program and the second is to use the <em>else</em> statement to execture a different set of code</li>               
            <li>An example:  if My_Name == 'John' print 'correct', else print 'incorrect'</li> 
            <li>The <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> booleans can be used in the if statement to execute the code if multiple test cases are all true (and) or if at least one of a list of test cases are true (or)</li>

            <li>A loop must have a way to exit the loop or it will run forever</li> 
            <li>Loops use test expressions just like if statements to determine if a loop should keep going or exit</li>
            <li>Each time through the loop the test expression is tested to see if its True, if so the loop is exited and if not the loop keeps going</li>

          Structured Data:  Lists and For Loops
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>The string is the most basic form of structured data made up of a sequence of characters</li>
            <li>We can operate down to each character within a string</li>
            <li>A string has limits because it only holds characters</li>
            <li>A <em>list</em> is a more complex data type because elements can be many different types (strings, ints, other lists)</li>
            <li>List format:  x=[a, b, c]</li>
            <li>Indexing a list gives the value at the index position x[0] would be 'a'</li>
            <li>An empty list can be created y = [ ]</li>
            <li>The other big advantage of Lists over strings is the concept <em>mutation</em></li>
            <li>Mutation allows us to replace a certain element in the list</li>
            <li>Mutation does not create a new list it actually changes the existing list</li>
            <li>If two varriables point at the same list element and that element is mutated both varriables were changed</li>
            <li>When a list is passed into a function the function operates on the origial list so changes are seen globally</li>
            <li>the .append method can be used to append an element at the end of a list</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Bugs will happen during coding, there is no way around it</li>
            <li>The important thing is to have a strategy to get rid of bugs</li>
            <li>There are some bugs that will cause the program not to run by creating a traceback error</li>
            <li>This is useful as it tells what type of error and what line it occured on</li>
            <li>Other bugs will not cause an error but when the program runs the wrong output is created</li>
            <li>These bugs are harder to notice and then find and fix</li>
            <li>Using temporary print statements in different parts of the code can be very useful in debugging because you can look at varriables at different points</li>
            <li>Testing of the code is vital to finding bugs</li>
            <li>Test cases should incude a consise range of potential inputs and then looking to ensure the outputs are what is expected</li>

            <li>The main purpose of programming is to solve problems therefore it is a key skill to master</li>
            <li>The first thing to do when solving a problem is to ensure you fully understand the problem else you may solve the wrong thing</li>
            <li>Computational problems have inputs and desired outputs, we must understand each</li>
            <li>All possible inputs are a set</li>   
            <li>The relationship between the inputs produce the desired output</li> 
            <li>Validate assumptions on the inputs which could limit the number of total inputs</li>
            <li>Clearly define what the expected outputs are</li>
            <li>Create some examples to test your inputs, outputs, and assumptions</li>
            <li>Consider how to solve the problem in a systematic way as a human solves the problem</li> 
            <li>Next write <em>Pseudocode</em> before writing actual code:</li>

                <li>Sometimes the pseudocode will not be the simplist way to solve the problem as the way humans think is not always the more efficient way to do something</li>
